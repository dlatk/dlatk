Details
=======

Specifies the name of the table containing extracted features. Features are usually created using one of the steps in Feature Extraction.
Expected column format of the table must/will contain at least the following:
group_id Contains the "group_id" id:doc:`fwflag_s` (i.e. type specified by :doc:`fwflag_c`). Is an index.
feat Contains the feature type. Could be n:doc:`fwflag_grams`, lexicon features, etc.
value Contains the straight up count of the feature for the group_id. For ngrams, is just occurrence count. For lexical features, is number of words matched for given feature & group_id.
group_norm Contain the "relative frequency" of each feature. See specific feature extraction pages for how it actually works.
