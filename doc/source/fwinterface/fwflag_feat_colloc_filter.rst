Switch

--feat_colloc_filter

Description
===========

Filter multigram features based on how commonly they appear together

Argument and Default Value
==========================

PMI threshold will be set to it's default which is 3.0 (overridden by :doc:`fwflag_set_pmi_threshold`)

Details
=======

This filters multigram features based on their PMI value/(number of words - 1) and creates a new feature table that contains only the multi grams that were above a given threshold.  The PMI value for a bigram b composed of word1 followed by word2 is calculated as follows:

In this case  is the number of times x shows up divided by the total number of words in a document.

Intuitively the PMI should be a measure of how much a word pair "goes together".
The PMI of a bigram like "happy birthday" will have a larger PMI.
The PMI of a bigram like "bird purple" will have a smaller PMI because it was probably just a random occurence.

We divide the PMI by the number of words minus 1 in order to normalize.. otherwise 3grams have much higher PMI values than 2grams.
